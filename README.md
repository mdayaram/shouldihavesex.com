The idea for this site came up after we found out that Russia has a national
sex day to boost births in the population.  Not only that, but the government
also offers <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6990802.stm">stipends</a>
to people who give birth exactly nine months after the national holiday.

Clearly, the first thing we did was to check if the US had a national sex day.
It did not.

The next logical step, obviously, was to see if we could create it.  After
minutes of realizing that all "sexday" related domains were taken, we eventually
got to the topic of whether we should even be having sex at all, and so, this
site was born.
